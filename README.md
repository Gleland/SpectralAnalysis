# SpectralAnalysis
Calculate absorption coefficients via the Beer-Lambert law from transmission spectra.
=======


## Installation
The first step will be to download this code onto your computer. You can do this by pasting the following into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/NauIceLab/SpectralAnalysis.git`


This will provide you with all of the necessary files, including two CSV files with example data. RawBackground.csv and RawData.csv are data files with spectra collected of an empty cell chamber and a pure methane (CH4) species, respectively. Both data sets were taken at 92 K.


## Running the code
First, you will run the code via the terminal with: `python GTanalysis.py`. This will start the program.
