# SpectralAnalysis

##Calculate absorption coefficients via the Beer-Lambert law from transmission spectra.
=======


### Installation
The first step will be to download this code onto your computer. You can do this by pasting the following into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/NauIceLab/SpectralAnalysis.git`


This will provide all of the necessary files to perform a test case to understand how the program operates step by step. Included are two CSV files with example data. BackgroundData.csv and RawData.csv are spectra collected of an empty cell chamber and pure methane (CH4) liquid. These spectra were taken at 92 Kelvin. 


### Running the code
First, you will run the code via the terminal with: `python GTanalysis.py`. This will start the program.
